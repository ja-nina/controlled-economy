# controlled-economy
A graphical user interface, build using javafx.

It serves as an analysis of market forces where investors trade on markets generated by the user.

IN A NUTSHELL:
The user can create markets, indexes, companies, currencies,
commodities in the control panel. While all of the above as stated, are created munually,
investors and funds appear automatically, proportionally to the number of assets available 
on the markets. The control panel can be used to set world parameters, such as the
number of transactions per minute, or the bear/bull ratio.

In the main window the user can see a list of all markets and assets available in the world.
Selecting an asset from the list shows a plot of the asset's prices over time, also letting the user compare prices 
of different assets.

Every investor, fund, company is a separate thread.
The investors'/funds' threads are responsible for generating buy or sell
transactions at random time intervals; moreover, an investor can
increase their budget at a random moment in time.
The buy-sell price should depend on the number of investors
buying/selling particular assets in time. Company threads generate revenue and profit at regular time
intervals.
A company thread can randomly increase its total number of shares.
